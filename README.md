# Stroke-Prediction-
Introduction:
Stroke is a severe medical condition that occurs when the blood vessels in the brain rupture, leading to brain damage. It is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early detection of stroke warning symptoms can help mitigate the severity of the condition. Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence. This project aims to predict strokes using a dataset containing clinical and personal variables. Three models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression, are implemented for prediction. The accuracy and performance of the models are evaluated using confusion matrices, and cross-validation scores are compared to assess model performance.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains clinical and personal variables relevant to stroke prediction. These variables include demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle factors. The dataset is assumed to be labeled, with each instance classified as either a stroke occurrence or non-occurrence.

Models Implemented:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN): A deep learning model that mimics the structure and function of the human brain. It is trained on the dataset to learn patterns and make predictions about stroke occurrence.

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): A classification algorithm that classifies new instances based on the similarity to their k nearest neighbors. In this project, KNN is used to predict strokes based on the features in the dataset.

Logistic Regression: A statistical classification algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent variable (stroke occurrence) and independent variables (features) using logistic functions. It predicts the probability of stroke occurrence.

Model Evaluation:
To evaluate the accuracy and performance of the implemented models, confusion matrices are used. A confusion matrix provides a tabular representation of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by each model. From the confusion matrices, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be derived, which provide insights into the model's predictive power.

Cross-Validation:
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalization ability of ML models. In this project, cross-validation scores are calculated for each model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the models on different combinations of these subsets, and evaluating their performance. By comparing the cross-validation scores of different models, their relative effectiveness and robustness can be determined.

Handling Unbalanced Datasets:
The dataset used in this project may suffer from class imbalance, i.e., a significant difference in the number of instances between stroke occurrences and non-occurrences. To address this issue, over-sampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be employed. SMOTE generates synthetic samples of the minority class to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project focuses on predicting stroke occurrences using machine learning and deep learning models. The ANN, KNN, and Logistic Regression models are implemented and evaluated using confusion matrices and cross-validation scores. The significance of handling unbalanced datasets is highlighted, and the importance of over-sampling techniques is emphasized. The project aims to provide insights into stroke prediction and contribute to the development of effective diagnostic tools for stroke prevention and management.
